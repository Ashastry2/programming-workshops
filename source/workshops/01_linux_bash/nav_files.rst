2. Navigation and File Operations
====================

Filesystem  *Runtime ~ 10 min*
  A filesystem is the a structure that organizes how files are stored on the computer. In Unix, the two most basic objects are files and directories. Files can be things like text files or pictures. Directories contain files or other directories. Simple stuff.
  
  The base directory of the Unix file system is called root, and it is symbolized by a forward slash, ``/``.

Navigation *Runtime ~ 10 min*
  The cd command is such a simple function that it doesn't even have a man page. It is not the only function that is used in navigating your filesystem. The ``pwd`` command outputs your current position:
  
..image: images/pwd.png
  :width: 40pt
  
Not very exciting.

Workshop 1: SCC and git
===========================


**SCC and git**
In this online workshop you will learn about the Shared Computing Cluster (SCC) that we use at BU.
You will also learn version control using ``git``.
 
You are expected to study the the following content:

- `The SCC <the_scc.html>`_
- `Submitting jobs <qsub.html>`_
- `GitHub tutorial <https://try.github.io>`_ wich will introduce you to the basic ``git`` commands such as ``git config``, ``git init``, ``git status``, ``git clone``, ``git add``, ``git commit``, ``git push``, and ``git pull``. 
- and the Version control with `git portion <git.html>`_


In the hands-on workshop we will work on ssh login, loading modules and job submitting. 
Then we will continue to clone a sample repository and work on forking, resolving conflicts and more advanced git commands.

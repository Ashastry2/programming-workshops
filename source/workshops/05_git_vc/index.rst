Workshop 7. Version Control with git
====================================

In this online workshop you will learn about version control using git. You are expected to study the materials and go over the ``git`` and ``GitHub`` tutorials before the workshop. You will also need an account on `GitHub <https://github.com>`_ before the workshop. In the hands-on workshop we will work with forking, resolving conflicts and more advanced git commands.

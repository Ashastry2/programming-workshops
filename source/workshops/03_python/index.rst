Workshop 2: SCC and git
===========================


**Python**
This workshop will serve as an introduction to Python. The workshop breaks into
two sections: a brief overview of Python as a programming language (with quick
examples and explanations of common functionality), and a problem-based workshop
where students will create a python script to perform protein synthesis
*in silico*. The introduction should be performed **before** the in-person
workshop. The workshop should be done in pairs, with both students alternating
who "drives".

Workshop 5: Machine Learning and Rapidminer
============================================


**Machine learning**
This workshop provides a basic introduction to machine learning. 
First we will talk about data preparation and exploration. 
Then we will introduce a general pipeline for unsupervised and supervised learning. 

You are expected to study the the following content:

- `Dataset exploration and validation <dataset.html>`_
- `Learning models <learning.html>`_

In the workshop, do some basic data exploration and modeling.

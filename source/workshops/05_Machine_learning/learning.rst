Workshop 5: Learning
============================================
After preparing the data we can learn it. 
There are 2 main learning methods: supervised, when we have *labels* and we want to learn a model using those to predict future samples (classification) or when we don't know the *label* and we simply want to find pattern and classes (clustering).

You can choose to code your models in **R** or **Python** or use high end interatice platforms such as **RapidMiner**, KNIME, or Weka.

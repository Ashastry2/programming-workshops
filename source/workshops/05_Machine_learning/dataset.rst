Workshop 5: The dataset
============================================

<h1> The data </h1>
The dataset in machine learning is a matrix (table) consisting of N rows (samples or instances) and M columns (features).

<h2 > Features </h2>
Features can be different types:
<ul>
  <li>Binominal (TRUE/FALSE)</li>
  <li>Categorial/nominal (different classes)</li>
  <li>Text - not supported by all applications</li>
  <li>Numeric (Real numbers)</li>
  <li>Integer (Natural numbers)</li>
</ul>

<em>Note </em> that a common mistake is to mischaracterize features. Nominal values are usually presented by numbers but cannot be compared. If not set properly, errors could occur.

Example: Many choose to set education status as 1: no college, 2: college degree, 3: post-graduate. Ask yourself, does 1.5 have a meaning? <br />
Example: Stages of a tumor is represented by numbers (1, 2, ..). <br />

Make sure to determine  To clarify you can use a charater in front of a nominal value.

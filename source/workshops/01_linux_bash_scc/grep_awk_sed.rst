Grep
--------------------


Grep (**G**\lobal **R**\egular **E**\xpression **P**\rint) finds a string in a given file or input.

.. code-block:: sh

    grep [options] [regexp] [filename]

Usecases
************

- Case-insensitive search (``grep -i``):

.. code-block:: sh

      grep -i 'mary' mary-lamb.txt


- Whole-word search (``grep -w``):

.. code-block:: sh

      grep -w 'as' mary-lamb.txt


- Inverted search (``grep -v``):

.. code-block:: sh

      grep -v ‘the’ mary-lamb.txt


- Print additional (trailing) context lines after match (``grep -A <NUM>``):

.. code-block:: sh

      grep -A1 'eager'  mary-lamb.txt


- Print additional (leading) context lines before match (``grep -B <NUM>``):

.. code-block:: sh

      grep -B2 'fleece'  mary-lamb.txt


- Print additional (leading and trailing) context lines before and after the match (``grep -C <NUM>``):

.. code-block:: sh

      grep -C3 'appear' mary-lamb.txt
      
      

AWK
--------------------

Named after the authors: Aho, Weinberger, Kernighan

.. code-block:: sh

      awk [options] [filename]

Usecases
************

- Print everything in the text file:

.. code-block:: sh

      awk '{print}' BRITE_students.txt

- Now, let's get the more specific. Let's ask for first names only:

.. code-block:: sh

      awk '{print $1}' BRITE_students.txt

- What if we want to see two columns at the same time (e.g. first and last names)?

.. code-block:: sh

      awk '{print $1" "$2}' BRITE_students.txt

- Now let's see what your info is (exact match):

.. code-block:: sh

      awk '$1=="Anastasia"' BRITE_students.txt

- How can we see a particular pattern in our cohort (e.g. students in Campbell lab)?

.. code-block:: sh

      awk '/Campbell/ {print $0}' BRITE_students.txt

- How many students are there whose name begins with "B"? 

.. code-block:: sh

      awk '/B/{++cnt} END {print "Count = ", cnt}' BRITE_students.txt


SED
------------

SED stands for "**S**\tream **ED**\itor". It is a widely used text processing Linux tool.

.. code-block:: sh

      sed [options] [filename]

Usecases
************

- Replacing or substituting string: ``sed`` command is mostly used to replace the text in a file. The below simple ``sed`` command replaces the word “unix” with “linux” in the file.

.. code-block:: sh

      sed 's/unix/linux/' geekfile.txt

Here the ``s`` specifies the substitution operation. The ``/`` are delimiters. The ``unix`` is the search pattern and the ``linux`` is the replacement string.

By default, the ``sed`` command replaces the first occurrence of the pattern in each line and it won’t replace the second, third, …occurrence in the line.

- Replacing the nth occurrence of a pattern in a line: Use the ``/1``, ``/2`` etc flags to replace the first, second occurrence of a pattern in a line. The below command replaces the second occurrence of the word ``unix`` with ``linux`` in a line.

.. code-block:: sh

      sed 's/unix/linux/2' geekfile.txt

- Replacing all the occurrence of the pattern in a line: The substitute flag ``/g`` (global replacement) specifies the ``sed`` command to replace all the occurrences of the string in the line.

.. code-block:: sh

      sed 's/unix/linux/g' geekfile.txt

- Replacing from nth occurrence to all occurrences in a line: Use the combination of ``/1``, ``/2``, etc. and ``/g`` to replace all the patterns from the nth occurrence of a pattern in a line. The following ``sed`` command replaces the third, fourth, fifth, … ``unix`` word with ``linux`` word in a line.

.. code-block:: sh

      sed 's/unix/linux/3g' geekfile.txt

- Replacing string on a specific line number: You can restrict the ``sed`` command to replace the string on a specific line number. An example is:

.. code-block:: sh

      sed '3 s/unix/linux/' geekfile.txt
      
The above ``sed`` command replaces the string only on the third line.

- Deleting lines from a particular file: ``sed`` command can also be used for deleting lines from a particular file. To Delete a particular line, e.g. 4 in this example:

.. code-block:: sh

      sed '4d' geekfile.txt
      
- To delete a last line:

.. code-block:: sh

      sed '$d' geekfile.txt
      
- To delete line from range 2 to 4:

.. code-block:: sh

      sed '2,4d' geekfile.txt

- To delete from 3d to last line:

.. code-block:: sh

      sed '3,$d' geekfile.txt


Exercises
--------------------

1.  Display all the lines of the file **mary-lamb.txt** that do NOT contain the word *lamb*. 

2. Display only those lines of the file **mary-lamb.txt** that contain the word *he* in them. The search should NOT be sensitive to case.

3. Display only those lines of the file **mary-lamb.txt** which contain either *lamb* or *Mary* words in the them. The search should not be sensitive to case.

4. How do you print the first name and faculty advisor of students whose last names contain the letter *u* (file **BRITE_students.txt**)?

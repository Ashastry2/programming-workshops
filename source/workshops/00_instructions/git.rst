Git
====================

Git command-line:
--------------------
Install git for windows - https://gitforwindows.org/


Git GUI:
--------------------

Git is best used as a command line interface. Although git GUIs are not as powerful as the command line, it is still nice to be able to visualize your commit history. Git for windows comes with a GUI, but I recommend trying GitKraken - it's cleaner and comes with a light and dark UI.

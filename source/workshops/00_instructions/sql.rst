**Install SQLite**

(Note: the SQLite program is called sqlite3)

**Windows:**

See this very useful video to install SQLite
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOJWL3oXDO8

**Mac and Linux:**

Should already be preinstalled.  To check, open a terminal window and type “sqlite3”.  To quit the program after you’ve started it, type “.quit”.

**GUI:**

There are two reasonably good GUIs for using SQLite.  I haven’t used either extensively, so can’t make a strong recommendation, but I prefered SQLite Studio..  

- **SQLite Studio**.  Download for all three major operating systems here: https://sqlitestudio.pl/index.rvt?act=download
- **DB Browser for SQLite**. Downloads are here: https://sqlitebrowser.org/

**Test**
Follow these steps:

- In all three major operating systems, open a command terminal and create and move to a directory called “sqlitedb”  
- create a new database file called test.db by typing: “sqlite3 test.db”  
- you should see something like this.  If so, it's working.

  .. code::

    version 3.13.0 2016-05-18 10:57:30
    Enter ".help" for usage hints.
    sqlite> 

- Exit the program by typing “.quit”
